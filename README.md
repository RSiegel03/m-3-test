## Customization

### favicon

The favourite icon (favicon) is used in a few places. Most notably it is the small icon present
in the browser tab and located next to the website title on bookmarks. It is also used on this
template in the navigation bar as a link for the home page.

It can be changed by replacing the image `src/images/favicon.png`. It should be a square image
512x512px. To be consistent with the style of the current icon, create a background circle with
the hex colour `#ffffff` and give the foreground image the colour `#3d8183`.
